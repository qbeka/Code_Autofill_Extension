# Privacy Policy

**Gmail Code Autofill** is a Chrome extension that reads verification codes from your Gmail inbox and automatically fills them into website forms. This extension is built with privacy and local-only data handling in mind.

---

## What This Extension Does

- Uses Google's OAuth system to request read-only access to your Gmail inbox.
- Periodically checks for new messages and extracts 6-digit verification codes using pattern matching.
- Sends the code to the currently active tab for autofill, if a matching input field is detected.

---

## What Data Is Accessed

- The extension reads the text content (snippet) of recent Gmail messages to find verification codes.
- No emails are saved, stored, or transmitted.
- No data is sent to any third-party server or external service.
- No analytics, logging, or telemetry is included.

---

## What Data Is Stored

This extension does **not** store or persist any user data. It does not maintain a database, sync information, or retain message content beyond immediate in-memory use for autofilling forms.

---

## Permissions

- **Gmail API (readonly):** Used solely to access message snippets and extract verification codes.
- **Active tab access:** Allows autofill into web forms on the userâ€™s active tab.
- **Storage (local):** Used only to manage simple extension state (e.g., auth token presence). No user data is stored.

---

## Data Sharing

- This extension does **not** sell, share, or transfer any data to third parties.
- All processing is performed locally on the user's device.

---

## Changes

Any future changes to this policy will be reflected in this document and the Chrome Web Store listing.
