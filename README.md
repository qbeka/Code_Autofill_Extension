# Code_Autofill_Extension
A Chrome extension that automatically reads verification codes from your Gmail inbox and fills them into website forms. Uses the Gmail API with read-only OAuth, processes everything locally, and never stores or transmits data.

- Autofills code fields on any active tab

## ðŸ”‘ OAuth Setup (if building yourself)

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. Create a new project and enable the Gmail API.
3. Set up OAuth credentials:
   - Type: Web Application
   - Add redirect URI: `https://<YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>.chromiumapp.org/`
4. Add your Gmail address as a test user in the OAuth consent screen.
5. Replace the `client_id` in `manifest.json` with your own.

## ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy

- Gmail is accessed via OAuth using the `gmail.readonly` scope.
- The extension never stores, sends, or logs your emails or codes.
- Code extraction and form autofill happen entirely on your local machine.
- No external services or telemetry.

This extension is **not** a data collection tool. It simply automates a common task, with user privacy as a priority.

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Open the included `test-form.html` file in a browser tab and send a test email to your Gmail with a message like:

Your verification code is: 123456

The extension should detect the email and autofill the test form after a short delay (polling interval).
